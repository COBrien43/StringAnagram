# StringAnagram

This project takes two strings and checks to see if they are anagrams of eachother. The requirements are that they need to contain the same characters and same length.

## Instructions to build and run
Open this project in Intellij, and open App.java. Within this class there is already an example given of some string anagrams, if you wish to test different words against the program, then replace the words given.

## Platform limitations
There are no known limitations that would affect the running of this code.

## Dependencies 
For the testing aspect of this project I used JUnit.

## Possible Improvements
In the future I would break up the method in the StringAnagram class, and create a seperate method or class to print the results. This would be to make the readabiltiy of the code better.
